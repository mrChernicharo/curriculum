	<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
	<p>Dec.2022 - present → Full Time Frontend Engineer at Qgiv. qgiv.com

		its
		tools, Qgiv is the largest company I have worked with so far. With a well-structured series of processes, at

	<p>June 2020 - Dec.2021 → Full Time Software Engineer at Versátil. versatec.com.br
		At Versátil I developed B2B applications for Oi, one of the biggest telecoms companies in Brazil. They lead the
		market in more than 10 Brazilian state capitals, providing optical fiber to more than 200 cities. At Versatil we
		managed a good part of their data: Our databases stored more than 2 million entries on a daily basis and it was
		up
		to us to manipulate all that data to come up with rich and reliable pieces of software. I have built lots of
		interactive data visualization widgets that provided business insights for their BI, management and operations
		teams.

	<p>May 2019 - Dec. 2020 → Freelance Web Developer at Clínica Laços. clinicalacos.com.br
		Clínica Laços is a Psychology clinic in Rio de Janeiro which was a pioneer in online consultations. With around
		1k consultations per month, my job there was at first to create and maintain their website. Later on they needed
		to
		optimize their processes - which at the time were still pretty analogic - so I built, tested and maintained an
		app through which their professionals schedule and manage their patients and consultations.
