		<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
		<p><strong>Dec.2022 - present</strong> Full Time Frontend Engineer at Qgiv. qgiv.com

		</p>

		<p><strong>June 2020 - Dec.2021</strong> Full Time Software Engineer at Versátil. versatec.com.br
			At Versátil I developed B2B applications for Oi, one of the biggest telecoms companies in Brazil. They lead
			the
			market in more than 10 Brazilian state capitals, providing optical fiber to more than 200 cities. At
			Versatil we
			managed a good part of their data: Our databases stored more than 2 million entries on a daily basis and it
			was
			up
			to us to manipulate all that data to come up with rich and reliable pieces of software. I have built lots of
			interactive data visualization widgets that provided business insights for their BI, management and
			operations
			teams.

		<p><strong>May 2019 - Dec. 2020</strong> Freelance Web Developer at Clínica Laços. clinicalacos.com.br
			Clínica Laços is a Psychology clinic in Rio de Janeiro which was a pioneer in online consultations. With
			around
			1k consultations per month, my job there was at first to create and maintain their website. Later on they
			needed
			to
			optimize their processes - which at the time were still pretty analogic - so I built, tested and maintained
			an
			app through which their professionals schedule and manage their patients and consultations.
